## Summary
I have unified the typography to Satoshi, refined the ProblemSection alignment, and evolved the Hero into the "Blueprint Edition" (V3). This version features architectural abstractions, increased text contrast (50%/85%), and parallax depth to align with the brand promise of systemic leverage. All previous versions are preserved for easy restoration.
