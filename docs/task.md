## Summary
I have unified the typography to Satoshi, refined the ProblemSection alignment, and evolved the Hero into the "Blueprint Edition" (V3). I have also successfully re-imagined the "Capture" visual as a "Crystallization of Vision" metaphor, featuring a 3D isometric base, extraction lines, and a flickering thought cloud. All changes have been verified in the browser.
