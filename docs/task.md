## Summary
I have unified the typography to Satoshi, refined the ProblemSection alignment, and implemented a high-performance "Digital Sculpture" HeroV2. The new Hero follows a 2-group conceptual model (Problem vs. Solution) with advanced typography and metallic glow effects. The original Hero is preserved as `HeroV1.tsx` for easy restoration.
