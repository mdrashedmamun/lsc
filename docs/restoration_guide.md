# LeverageStack: Hero Version Control & Restoration Guide

I have maintained three distinct versions of your Hero section to allow for strategic choice.

## Restoration Instructions
To switch versions, simply ask me: **"Switch the Hero to [Version Name]"**.

| Version Name | Description | Conceptual Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hero V1** | Original "Three-Beat" Manifesto | Authority through clear, sequential storytelling. |
| **Hero V2** | "Digital Sculpture" (Standard) | High-end editorial focus on Problem vs. Solution. |
| **Hero V3** | **"The Blueprint Edition"** (Current) | Systemic Richness. Adds architectural patterns & contrast boost. |

---

## Technical Mapping (For Reference)
If you wish to do it yourself in `App.tsx`:

1.  **V1:** Import `HeroV1` from `./components/HeroV1`.
2.  **V2:** Import `HeroV2_Standard` from `./components/HeroV2_Standard`.
3.  **V3:** Import `HeroV2` from `./components/HeroV2` (This is where the latest blueprint live).

## What changed in V3 (The Blueprint Edition)?
- **Visibility:** Lower opacities increased from 30% → 50% and 70% → 85% for better legibility.
- **Visual Richness:** Added a subtle **Isometric Grid Overlay** and **Drafting Lines** at 5% opacity to visualize "The Architecture of Leverage."
- **Parallax:** The background patterns move vertically as you scroll, creating a sense of 3D depth and systemic sophistication.
