Your website has a strong premium foundation with distinctive bronze/emerald branding and sophisticated editorial copy. However, it's currently optimized    \
 for brand perception at the expense of conversion and readability.                                                                                           \

 Key Findings:                                                                                                                                                \
 - \uc0\u9989  Strengths: Unique visual identity, sophisticated tone, clear problem articulation                                                                       \
 - \uc0\u9888 \u65039  Critical Gaps: Low CTA visibility, readability/contrast issues, lack of credibility signals, abstract messaging overshadowing concrete value            \
 - \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Impact: These gaps are likely reducing conversion rates by 30-50%                                                                                       \

 Recommended Approach: Implement High Priority changes first (conversion blockers), then Medium Priority (UX improvements), then Low Priority (polish).       \

 Problem: "Book a call" buttons are nearly invisible (30% opacity borders) with generic copy.                                                                 \

 1. Increase border opacity from border-bronze-metallic/30 to border-bronze-metallic/50                                                                       \

 Problem: Light font weight (300) + reduced opacity creates anemic readability, especially on pricing cards.                                                  \

 Problem: No testimonials, case studies, or client logos = trust gap for skeptical founders.                                                                  \
